## suggestions

- Create a folder in your name , all all the componets you are creating can be added there , after we all review it we can add it in the main code
- make a readme in that file, describing what are you doing example - login/logout form - break them down , make small components and build the later we can together descide on adding or removing it

  - list of the componets - from here everyone can select one and then mark it as selected which ever you preffered
  - Forms
  - navigations
  - modals
  - overlays
  - cards
  - product display
